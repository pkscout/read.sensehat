As noted, some of these are for the Kodi addon with which this interacts

For script:
NOW:
nothing

LATER:
- react to Kodi request for brightness change
- react to Kodi request to toggle auto dimming
- react to Kodi information about input.enablemouse setting
- have a default for whether the weatherstation has a touchscreen or not
- have two keyboard mappings, one for touchscreen/joystick, one for joystick only


For Kodi addon:
NOW:
nothing

LATER:
- add code to send JSON-RPC notification for brightness change (up and down)
- add code to send JSON-RPC notification to toggle auto dimming
- add code to send JSON-RPC to send status of input.enablemouse setting 


For Kodi skin:
- add a Window for control functions (brightness, toggle autodim, open settings)
