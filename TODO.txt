As noted, some of these are for the Kodi addon with which this interacts

For script:
NOW:
nothing

LATER:
- read settings from Kodi for auto dimming
- add setting indicating whether using touchscreen
- have two keyboard mappings, one for touchscreen/joystick, one for joystick only


For Kodi addon:
NOW:
nothing

LATER:
- have Auto Dim setting that would be used instead of the one in the script
- add brightness controls (might need separate addon)
